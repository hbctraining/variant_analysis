# Introduction to Variant Calling

## Learning Objectives

- Evaluate QC metrics for variant calling
- Call variants using GATK
- Filter variants to retain only high-quality variant calls
- Annotate variants using SnpEff and dbSNP
- Prioritize variants by their impact
- Visualize variants in IGV

## Installations

### On your desktop

1. [FileZilla Client](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client) (make sure you get ‘FileZilla Client')
2. [Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/)

### On your HPCC (if not using Harvard's O2 cluster)

#### Required
1. [`FastQC`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) version 0.11.9
2. [`bwa`](https://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net) version 0.7.17
3. [`Picard`](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) version 2.27.5
4. [`MultiQC`](https://multiqc.info) version 1.12
5. [`GATK`](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us) version 4.1.9.0
6. [`SnpEff and SnpSift suite`](http://pcingola.github.io/SnpEff/) version 4.3g

#### Optional
1. [`samtools`](https://github.com/samtools/samtools) version 1.15.1
2. [`bedtools`](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) version 2.30.0

> ***NOTE:*** If you are not working on the O2 cluster and are using different versions of these software programs, these packages may still work with the provided commands. However,this workshop was designed on these versions specifically, so you may need to tweak some of the commands if you use different versions of this software.
